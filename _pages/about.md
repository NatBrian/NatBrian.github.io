Hi!
I am Brian, an undergraduate student at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). I am currently pursuing my Bachelor degree in Computer Science, focusing on Data Science; with minor in Actuarial Mathematics and Technology Entrepreneurship.

I have jobs experiences working in Citibank and Deloitte Consulting. I did my last internship in Citibank as a summer analyst in GCB (Global Consumer Banking) Operation and Technology, working on Citi's data center onshoring project. Additionally, I did my internship in Deloitte Consulting, working on enterprise architecture for client's digitalization project. 

Currently, I am doing my research with [Perception and Robotics Group at the University of Maryland, College Park](http://prg.cs.umd.edu/). My current research is on improving speech recognition in adverse condition.

I am currently looking for a full time opportunity as a software engineer or a software developer. I am open to other technology positions as well.
